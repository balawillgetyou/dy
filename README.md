This is a repository of some of my data science projects, limited to what can be shared openly and not subject to employer/ client confidentiality conditions. Initially I'd posted some projects worked on to fulfill course requirements of the Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. But I've added more content since then.
